# ⚾ Momentum Shift Score (MSS)

**Momentum Shift Score (MSS)** is a novel, player-specific baseball analytics metric that captures the psychological and statistical impact of key moments in games. It helps quantify how a pivotal play, like a walk-off homer or a blown save, can alter a player's future performance.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- **Create a predictive, player-specific metric** that reflects the impact of pivotal moments in baseball.
- **Assist analysts and scouts** in identifying potential breakout or fall-off points in a player's season.
- **Capture narrative context** using data and media sentiment to enhance traditional stats.
- **Deliver a transparent, explainable tool** in a Jupyter Notebook format with rich visualizations and case studies.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Player-Level Scoring**: Calculates MSS differently for each player affected by a given moment.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Weighs moments based on game situation (e.g., regular season vs. postseason).
- **Predictive Modeling**: Estimates a player’s future performance post-moment using ML and historical data.
- **Narrative Integration**: Leverages media sentiment analysis and public narratives via NLP techniques.
- **Statcast + Savant Data**: Integrates advanced pitch and batted ball metrics for context-rich analysis.
- **Heuristic + ML Hybrid**: Combines explainable rules with supervised machine learning for robustness.
