    "# Momentum Shift Score: Quantifying Career-Altering Moments in Major League Baseball\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "This analysis focuses on identifying and evaluating pivotal moments in baseball games—specifically, events involving a pitched ball that result in the greatest changes in Win Probability Added (WPA). The goal is to assess how these moments influence the career trajectories of both the pitcher and the hitter. By quantifying this phenomenon into a single metric, we aim to provide a comprehensive narrative of how critical moments can shape the careers of the players involved.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball, often referred to as America’s pastime, is a sport deeply rooted in tradition and statistical analysis. Over the years, the advent of advanced metrics has revolutionized the way the game is understood, evaluated, and appreciated. Among these metrics, Win Probability Added (WPA) has emerged as a powerful tool to quantify the impact of individual plays on the outcome of a game. However, while WPA provides a game-level perspective, its implications on the career trajectories of players remain largely unexplored.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to bridge that gap by introducing the concept of the Momentum Shift Score (MSS). The MSS is designed to quantify career-altering moments in Major League Baseball (MLB), focusing on pivotal events that result in significant changes in WPA. By analyzing these moments, we aim to uncover their influence on the long-term narratives of the players involved—both pitchers and hitters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a combination of data-driven analysis and contextual storytelling, this project will highlight how singular moments, such as a critical home run or a game-changing strikeout, can define or redefine a player’s career. By leveraging tools like Statcast data, sentiment analysis, and historical context, we aim to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the intersection of performance, pressure, and legacy in professional baseball. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, this research aspires to contribute to the broader discourse on sports analytics, offering a novel perspective on how individual moments resonate beyond the confines of a single game, shaping the legacies of players and the narratives of the sport itself."
