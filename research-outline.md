# Momentum Shift Score (MSS): Quantifying Career-Altering Moments in Major League Baseball

## 1. Introduction
- **Background on baseball analytics**: Brief overview of the evolution of baseball statistics from traditional to advanced metrics
- **Gap in current metrics**: Explanation of how existing metrics fail to capture the long-term impact of pivotal moments on player trajectories
- **Introduction to MSS**: Definition of the Momentum Shift Score as a novel metric that captures both statistical and psychological impacts
- **Research objectives**: Clear statement of the goals of the study
- **Significance of the research**: Explanation of how MSS could benefit analysts, scouts, teams, and fans

## 2. Literature Review
- **Traditional baseball statistics**: Overview of conventional metrics (BA, ERA, etc.)
- **Advanced metrics evolution**: Discussion of sabermetrics movement and metrics like WAR, OPS+, WPA
- **Win Probability Added (WPA)**: Detailed examination as the foundation for MSS
- **Psychological aspects in sports**: Review of existing research on clutch performance, pressure situations, and career-defining moments
- **Media influence on player perception**: Analysis of how narrative shapes player evaluation
- **Current gaps in baseball analytics**: Identification of the need for metrics that bridge statistical and narrative elements

## 3. Methodology
- **Defining a "moment"**: Criteria for what constitutes a pivotal baseball moment
- **Data sources**: Description of Statcast, Baseball Savant, and other data sources
- **MSS calculation framework**: 
  - Game context variables (inning, score differential, playoff vs. regular season)
  - Player context variables (career stage, previous performance)
  - Win Probability Added (WPA) significance
  - Media and fan reaction measurement
- **Sentiment analysis approach**: Methods for quantifying media and fan reactions
- **Machine learning model**: Explanation of predictive modeling components

## 4. Case Studies
- **Case Study 1: Pete Alonso HR off Devin Williams (2024 NL Wild Card)**
  - Background and game context
  - Pitch-by-pitch breakdown of the at-bat
  - WPA analysis
  - Media and fan sentiment analysis
  - Performance changes post-moment for both players
  - Calculated MSS and interpretation
- **Case Study 2: Freddie Freeman Walk-Off Grand Slam vs. Nestor Cortes (2024 World Series)**
  - [Similar structure to Case Study 1]
- **Case Study 3: Jose Altuve Walk-Off HR vs. Aroldis Chapman (2017 ALCS)**
  - [Similar structure to Case Study 1]

## 5. Results
- **MSS calculation results**: Presentation of MSS scores for selected case studies
- **Correlation analysis**: Relationship between MSS and future performance metrics
- **Predictive power assessment**: Evaluation of how well MSS predicts performance changes
- **Comparative analysis**: How MSS differs from and complements existing metrics
- **Player type analysis**: Differences in MSS impact based on player positions and roles

## 6. Discussion
- **Interpretation of findings**: What the MSS reveals about career-altering moments
- **Psychological implications**: Discussion of mental resilience, pressure handling, and career narrative
- **Practical applications**: 
  - For teams and front offices (player evaluation, contract decisions)
  - For coaches (identifying psychological strengths/vulnerabilities)
  - For media and fans (contextualizing player narratives)
- **Limitations of the MSS**: Acknowledgment of constraints and potential weaknesses of the metric

## 7. Future Work
- **Refinement of the MSS calculation**: Areas for improvement in the formula
- **Expansion to other sports**: Potential application to basketball, football, etc.
- **Integration with existing metrics**: How MSS could complement traditional evaluation systems
- **Longitudinal studies**: Proposals for tracking MSS impact over entire careers
- **Real-time MSS calculation**: Potential for in-game applications

## 8. Conclusion
- **Summary of key findings**: Recapitulation of the most important results
- **Broader implications**: What MSS contributes to sports analytics as a field
- **Final thoughts**: The value of quantifying narrative and psychological elements in sports
